# Home Assistant config

This is my Home Assistant configuration.
I try to connect most of the hardware and services that I often use. We use the iOS app to manage and find the information we need. The goal is to automate what we can, but also to have one stop where we find all the information about the house, weather, cars, activity etc.
The setup is running a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
